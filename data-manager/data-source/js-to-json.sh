# We use Tommy's Teambuilder as source of our data. They have prepared
# JavaScript objects with information about all Pokemon, Moves and
# Pokemon-Moves maps. The problem is, JavaScript object is close to
# JSON, but not quite there. No JSON library in Python could read
# these files as-is.
# Since reading internal JavaScript objects is not task commonly
# solved by languages other than JavaScript, we resort to use
# NodeJS (!) to read object from file, serialize it as JSON and
# write it back.
# And since NodeJS expects certain structure from its modules,
# we rewrite files before processing them.
